> #### Features and Mechanics

* The Player's speed is finely tuned to deliver a balanced yet thrilling experience.

* All vessels in the game world are responsive to collisions, allowing for dynamic interactions as the Player navigates the Lake Of Fire.

* Player Score is displayed and incremented each time a PickUp is collected, keeping track of the Player's performance.

* Player can interact with various GameObjects that provide either a speed boost, enhancing their mobility, _or_ cause a slowdown effect, affecting their movement.

* Player faces a timed challenge as they journey through the depths of Hell to make it to a safer destination and as time shortens, the Player risks melting away into the Lake Of Fire.

* Win or lose conditions are established to determine the outcome of the Player's efforts.
